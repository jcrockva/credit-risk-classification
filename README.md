Overview of the Analysis
This analysis evaluated the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting the credit risk of loan applicants using historical financial data. The target variable for this analysis was loan status, which indicates whether a loan was fully paid or written off.

The dataset contained various features such as income, debt-to-income ratio, number of open accounts, revolving credit utilization. These features were used to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan.

The machine learning pipeline involved the following steps:

Loading and preprocessing the data, including converting categorical variables and standardizing numerical values.

Separating the data into training and testing sets.

Applying and evaluating the machine learning model.

The models tested included:

Logistic Regression
